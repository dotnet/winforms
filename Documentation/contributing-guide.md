# Contributing Guide

The primary focus of .NET Core 3.0 release for Windows Forms is to achieve parity with .NET Framework. Priority will be given to changes that align with that goal.

* Test fixes, test improvements and new tests increasing code coverage.
* Infrastructure fixes and improvements.
* Bug fixes that specificually target partity between .NET Core and .NET Framework.
