# Building Windows Forms

## Prerequisites ##
Follow the prerequisites listed at [Building CoreFX on Windows](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/Documentation/building/windows-instructions.md)

## Building from the command line
* Run `.\build` from the repo root.
  * Builds the `System.Windows.Forms.sln` using the default config (Debug|Any CPU)
* To specify a config, add `-configuration` followed by the config such as `.\build -configuration Release`

If your build is successful, you should see something like this:
```console
Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

Note that this does **not** build using your machine-wide installed version of the dotnet sdk. It builds using the dotnet sdk specified in the global.json in the repo root.

## Building from Visual Studio
* To build from Visual Studio, open System.Windows.Forms.sln in Visual Studio and build how you normally would.
* Visual Studio behaves slightly differently than the command line. It uses the machine-wide installed SDK instead of the one specified in the global.json.
  * Please make sure you have the [latest .Net Core Daily Build](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/daily-builds.md) installed.

## Build outputs
* All build outputs are generated under the artifacts folder.
* Binaries are under artifacts\bin
  * For example, System.Windows.Forms.dll can be found under artifacts\bin\System.Windows.Forms\Debug\netcoreapp3.0
* Logs are found under artifacts\log
* Packages are found under artifacts\packages

## Troubleshooting build errors
* Most build errors are compile errors and can be dealt with accordingly.
* Other error may be from MSBuild tasks. You need to examine the build logs to investigate.
  * The logs are generated at artifacts\log\Debug\Build.binlog
  * The file format is an MSBuild Binary Log. Install the [MSBuild Structured Log Viewer](http://msbuildlog.com/) to read them.

## Creating a package
To create the Microsoft.Private.Winforms package, run `.\build -pack`
