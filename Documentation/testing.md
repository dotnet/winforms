# Windows Forms Unit Testing

This document describes our approach to unit testing.

We are still working on a scalable solution for functional testing.

## Building tests
Tests are automatically built when running `.\build` since all test projects are referenced in `System.Windows.Forms.sln` at the repo root.

## Running tests

### Testing from the command line
To execute unit tests, run `.\build -test`

If all the tests are successful, you should see something like this:
```console
  Running tests: E:\src\repos\github\winforms\artifacts\bin\System.Windows.Forms.Tests\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\System.Windows.Forms.Tests.dll [netcoreapp3.0|x64]
  Tests succeeded: E:\src\repos\github\winforms\artifacts\bin\System.Windows.Forms.Tests\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\System.Windows.Forms.Tests.dll [netcoreapp3.0|x64]

Build succeeded.
    0 Warning(s)
    0 Error(s)
```

### Troubleshooting command-line test errors
When testing from the command line, a failed test should look something like this:
```console
Running tests: E:\src\repos\github\winforms\artifacts\bin\System.Windows.Forms.Tests\Debug\netcoreapp3.0\System.Windows.Forms.Tests.dll [netcoreapp3.0|x64]
XUnit : error : Tests failed: E:\src\repos\github\winforms\artifacts\TestResults\Debug\System.Windows.Forms.Tests_netcoreapp3.0_x64.html [netcoreapp3.0|x64] [E:\src\repos\github\winforms\src\System.Windows.Forms\tests\UnitTests\System.Windows.Forms.Tests.csproj]
XUnit : error : Tests failed: E:\src\repos\github\winforms\artifacts\TestResults\Debug\System.Windows.Forms.Tests_netcoreapp3.0_x64.html [netcoreapp3.0|x64] [E:\src\repos\github\winforms\src\System.Windows.Forms\tests\UnitTests\System.Windows.Forms.Tests.csproj]

Build FAILED.
```

* The test summary can be found under artifacts\log
* To see the actual test(s) that failed, along with their error message(s), open the .html file that is displayed in the error message (which is always under `artifacts\TestResults`)

### Testing from Visual Studio
To test from Visual Studio, open System.Windows.Forms.sln in Visual Studio and test how you normally would (using the Test Explorer, for example)

### Troubleshooting Visual Studio test errors
* When testing from Visual Studio, test errors show up as normal in the test explorer.
* To troubleshoot, debug the selected test and set breakpoints as you normally would.

## Adding new tests
Tests are built and executed by file name convention
* Every WinForms binary has its own folder under src in the repo root (src\System.Windows.Forms, for example)
* Each of those folders has a tests folder under it (src\System.Windows.Forms\tests, for example)
* Each tests folder contains an xUnit test project (System.Windows.Forms.Tests.csproj)
  * These test projects automatically build when running .\build
  * The tests from these projects automatically execute when running .\build -test

**Therefore, you just need to put your tests in the right place in order for them to run**
* Browse to the tests folder for the binary you are testing
* There should be one file per class being tested, and the file name should match the class name.
  * For example, if I wanted to test the Button class in System.Windows.Forms.dll, I would look for a Button.cs under src\System.Windows.Forms\tests
* If the file exists, add your tests there. If it doesn't exist, feel free to create it.
  * **Note that you don't have to modify the csproj at all.** Since the project is a Microsoft.NET.Sdk project, all source files next to it are automatically included

### Test best pactices
Naming
* Test files names should match the class they are testing
  * For example, tests for the Button class should be in Button.cs
* Test class names should match the class they are testing, followed by "Tests"
  * For example, tests for the Button class should in the ButtonTests class
* Test names should start with the class they are testing
  * For example, all tests for the button class should start with "Button"
* Test names should end with a description of what the test does
  * For example, Button_AutoSizeModeGetSet
  * This is very useful when viewing test results, and when browsing in the test explorer

Strategy
* **Unit tests should be part of the same PR as code changes**
  * Please test internal methods as well, not just publics. 
* Avoid duplicating tests just for different inputs
  * Use `[Theory]` for this, followed by either `[InlineData]` or `[MemberData]`. See existing tests for examples on how to use these attributes
  * The exception to this is if the code behavior is fundamentally different based on the inputs. For example, if a method throws an ArgumentException for invalid inputs, that should be a separate test.
* One test (or test data) per code path please
  * The most common exception to this is when testing a property, most people test get/set together
* Whenever possible, mock up dependencies to run tests in isolation
  * For example, if your method accepts an abstraction, use Moq to mock it up
  * Search for Mock in the existing tests for examples, and see [Moq](https://github.com/Moq/moq4/wiki/Quickstart) for details on how to use Moq.
