# Windows Forms

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green.svg)](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/blob/master/LICENSE.TXT)

Windows Forms (WinForms) is a UI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It is a .NET wrapper over Windows user interface libraries, such as User32 and GDI+. It also offers controls and other functionality that is unique to Windows Forms.

Windows Forms also provides one of the most productive ways to create desktop applications based on the visual designer provided in Visual Studio. It enables drag-and-drop of visual controls and other similar functionality that make it easy to build desktop applications.

### Windows Forms Designer
For more information about the designer, please see the [Windows Forms Designer Documentation](docs/winforms-designer.md).<br />

### Relationship to .NET Framework

This codebase is a fork of the Windows Forms code in the .NET Framework 4.8. 
In Windows Forms .NET Core 3.0, we've strived to bring the two runtimes to a parity. However since then, we've done a number of changes, including [breaking changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/compatibility/winforms), which diverged the two.
For more information about breaking changes, see the [Porting guide][porting-guidelines].
