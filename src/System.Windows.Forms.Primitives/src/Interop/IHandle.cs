///  Used to abstract access to classes that contain a potentially owned handle.

/// <remarks>
///  The key benefit of this is that we can keep the owning class from being
///  collected during interop calls. <see cref="HandleRef"/> wraps arbitrary
///  owners with target handles. Having this interface allows implicit use
///  of the classes (such as System.Windows.Forms.Control) that
///  meet this common pattern in interop and encourages correct alignment
///  with the proper owner.
///
///  Note that keeping objects alive is necessary ONLY when the object has
///  a finalizer that will explicitly close the handle.
