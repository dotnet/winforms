///   The key benefit of this is that we can keep the owning class from being collected during interop calls.
///   <see cref="HandleRef"/> wraps arbitrary owners with target handles. Having this interface allows implicit use
///   of the classes (such as System.Windows.Forms.Control) that meet this common pattern in interop and encourages
///   correct alignment with the proper owner.

///  <para>
///   Note that keeping objects alive is necessary ONLY when the object has a finalizer that will explicitly

///  <para>
///   When implementing P/Invoke wrappers that take this interface they should not directly take
///   <see cref="IHandle{THandle}"/>, but should take a generic "T" that is constrained to IHandle{T}. Doing
///   it this way prevents boxing of structs. The "T" parameters should also be marked as <see langword="in"/>
///   to allow structs to be passed by reference instead of by value.

///  <para>
///   When implementing this on a struct it is important that either the struct itself is marked as readonly
