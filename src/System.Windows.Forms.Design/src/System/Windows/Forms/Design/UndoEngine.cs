            // The logic in here is subtle.  This code handles both committing and cancelling of nested transactions.  Here's a summary of how it works:
            // 1.  Each time a transaction is opened, a new unit is pushed onto  the unit stack.
            // 2.  When a change occurs, the change event checks to see if there is a currently executing unit.  It also checks to see if the current unit stack is empty.  If there is no executing unit (meaning that nothing is performing an undo right now), and if the unit stack is empty, the change event will create a new undo unit and push it on the stack.
            // 3.  The change event always runs through all undo units in the undo stack and calls the corresponding change method.  In the normal case of a single transaction or no transaction, this will operate on just one unit.  In the case of nested transactions there are two possibilities:
            //          a)  We are adding undo information to a nested transaction. We want to add the undo information to all levels of nested transactions.  Why?  Because as a nested transaction is closed, it is either committed or cancelled.  If committed, and if the transaction is not the top-most transaction, the transaction is actually just thrown away because its data is redundantly stored in the next transaction on the stack.
            //          b)  We are adding undo information to a nested transaction, but that undo information is being created because an undo unit is being "undone".  Remember that for nested transactions each undo unit higher on the stack has all the data that the lower units have.  When a lower unit is undone, it is popped from the stack and all of the changes it makes are recorded on the higher level units.  This combines the "do" and "undo" data into the higher level unit, which in effect subtracts the undone data from the higher level unit.
            // 4.  When a unit is undone it stores itself in a member variable called _executingUnit.  All change events examine this variable and if it is set they do not create a new unit in response to a change.  Instead, they just run through all the existing units.  This builds the undo history for a transaction that is being rolled back.

A property change undo event must have all BeforeUndo methods called before any Undo method is called. To do this, we have a property on UndoEvent called CausesSideEffects.
                        // As we run through UndoEvents, consecutive events that return true from this property are grouped so that their BeforeUndo methods are all called before their Undo methods.  For events that do not have  side effects, their BeforeUndo and Undo are invoked immediately.
