    /// IOverlayService is a service that supports adding simple overlay windows to a design surface. Overlay windows can be used to paint extra glyphs on top of existing controls. Once an overlay is added, it will be forced on top of the Z-order for the other controls and overlays. If you want the overlay to be transparent, then you must do this work yourself. A typical way to make an overlay control transparent is to use the method setRegion on the control class to define the non-transparent portion of the control.
