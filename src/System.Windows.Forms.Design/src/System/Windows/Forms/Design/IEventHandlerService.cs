    ///     The event handler service provides a unified way to handle
    ///     the various events that our form designer must process.  What
    ///     we want to be able to do is to write code in one place that
    ///     handles events of a certain type.  We also may need to globally
    ///     change the behavior of these events for modal functions like
    ///     the tab order UI.  Our designer, however, is in many pieces
    ///     so we must somehow funnel these events to a common place.
    ///     This service implements an "event stack" that contains the
    ///     current set of event handlers.  There can be different
    ///     types of handlers on the stack.  For example, we may push
    ///     a keyboard handler and a mouse handler.  When you request
    ///     a handler, we will find the topmost handler on the stack
    ///     that fits the class you requested.  This way the service
    ///     can be extended to any eventing scheme, and it also allows
    ///     sections of a handler to be replaced (eg, you can replace
    ///     mouse handling without effecting menus or the keyboard).
