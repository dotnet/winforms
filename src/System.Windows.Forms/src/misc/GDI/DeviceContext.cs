    ///  Represents a Win32 device context.  Provides operations for setting some of the properties
    ///  of a device context.  It's the managed wrapper for an HDC.
    ///
    ///  This class is divided into two files separating the code that needs to be compiled into
    ///  reatail builds and debugging code.
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    ///  This class is a wrapper to a Win32 device context, and the Hdc property is the way to get a
    ///  handle to it.
    ///
    ///  The hDc is released/deleted only when owned by the object, meaning it was created internally;
    ///  in this case, the object is responsible for releasing/deleting it.
    ///  In the case the object is created from an exisiting hdc, it is not released; this is consistent
    ///  with the Win32 guideline that says if you call GetDC/CreateDC/CreatIC/CreateEnhMetafile, you are
    ///  responsible for calling ReleaseDC/DeleteDC/DeleteEnhMetafile respectivelly.
    ///
    ///  This class implements some of the operations commonly performed on the properties of a dc  in WinForms,
    ///  specially for interacting with GDI+, like clipping and coordinate transformation.
    ///  Several properties are not persisted in the dc but instead they are set/reset during a more comprehensive
    ///  operation like text rendering or painting; for instance text alignment is set and reset during DrawText (GDI),
    ///  DrawString (GDI+).
    ///
    ///  Other properties are persisted from operation to operation until they are reset, like clipping,
    ///  one can make several calls to Graphics or WindowsGraphics obect after setting the dc clip area and
    ///  before resetting it; these kinds of properties are the ones implemented in this class.
    ///  This kind of properties place an extra chanllenge in the scenario where a DeviceContext is obtained
    ///  from a Graphics object that has been used with GDI+, because GDI+ saves the hdc internally, rendering the
    ///  DeviceContext underlying hdc out of sync.  DeviceContext needs to support these kind of properties to
    ///  be able to keep the GDI+ and GDI HDCs in sync.
    ///
    ///  A few other persisting properties have been implemented in DeviceContext2, among them:
    ///
    ///   1. Window origin.
    ///   2. Bounding rectangle.
    ///   3. DC origin.
    ///   4. View port extent.
    ///   5. View port origin.
    ///   6. Window extent
    ///
    ///  Other non-persisted properties just for information: Background/Forground color, Palette, Color adjustment,
    ///  Color space, ICM mode and profile, Current pen position, Binary raster op (not supported by GDI+),
    ///  Background mode, Logical Pen, DC pen color, ARc direction, Miter limit, Logical brush, DC brush color,
    ///  Brush origin, Polygon filling mode, Bitmap stretching mode, Logical font, Intercharacter spacing,
    ///  Font mapper flags, Text alignment, Test justification, Layout, Path, Meta region.
