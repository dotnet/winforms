## Accessibility testing  <!-- Remove this section if PR does not change UI -->

<!--
     Microsoft prioritizes making our products accessible. 
     WinForms has a key role in allowing developers to create accessible apps. 
     
     When submitting a change which impacts UI in any way, including adding new UI or
     modifying existing controls the developer needs to run the Accessibility Insights
     tool (https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and verify that there are no changes or
     regressions. 
     
     The developer should run the Fast Pass over the impacted control(s) and provide
     a snapshot of the passing results along with before/after snapshots of the UI.
     More info: (https://accessibilityinsights.io/docs/en/web/getstarted/fastpass)

## Test environment(s) <!-- Remove any that don't apply -->
