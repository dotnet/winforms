# Windows Forms Out-Of-Process Designer

The Windows Forms Out-Of-Process Designer (or the OOP designer) is currently available as a pre-release Visual Studio feature in [Visual Studio 2019 or later](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/preview/). You can enable the OOP designer via **Tools -> Options -> Environment -> Preview Features** with **Use the preview Windows Forms designer for .NET Core apps**.
 Releases of .NET Core Windows Forms Designer are tied to Visual Studio Preview releases, so update to the latest Visual Studio Preview version to get the latest designer features.
