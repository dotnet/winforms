# WinForms on .NET Core Roadmap

This roadmap communicates priorities for evolving and extending the scope of WinForms for .NET Core.

At present, our primary focus is enabling the following for .NET Core 3.0:

* Achieve WinForms functional and performance parity compared to .NET Framework
* Publish remaining WinForms components to the repository
* Publish (and write) more WinForms tests to the repository

> Note: There are some specific .NET Framework features will not be supported, such as hosting WinForms controls in Internet Explorer.

As we complete those goals, we'll update our roadmap to include additional feature/capability areas we will focus on next.

For general information regarding .NET Core plans, see [.NET Core
roadmap][core-roadmap].
